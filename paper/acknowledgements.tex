We would like to acknowledge the good discussion we have had about spatial database queries and cartographic generalization with Lars Loldrup and Brian Haunstrup at Grontmij, as well as the valuable input provided by Anders Friis-Christensen and Morten Lindegaard at the Danish Geodata Agency regarding future directions for CVL.
