\section{Background}
Cartography as a field has long tradition spanning hundreds of years, and has rightly been considered as much an art as a science. Until recently automated cartographic generalization carried a lot of this legacy. With the appearance of high-quality user created background maps which are shared online, the focus has recently shifted away from generalizing topographical data, to dealing with simpler datasets used as overlays to supplement e.g. news stories~\cite{fusiontables,datajournalism}.  This has led to a reboot of the area of cartographic generalization \cite{fusiontables}. In this new version of the field, a generally much more uniform approach is taken to generalizing data. The trends has been to largely ignore the domain of the data, and focus mainly on the pure geometric properties~\cite{fusiontables}. The focus is on performance, scalability and reasonably good average quality, while perhaps sacrificing the ability to generalize rich topographical datasets.
