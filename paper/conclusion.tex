\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a novel approach to the data reduction problem in map generalization. The proposed approach is complete in the sense that it integrates seamlessly with existing database and cartographic generalization technology. It allows users to specify, using the proposed CVL language, and across all scales, what properties the generated map should fulfill --- leaving the detailed filtering decisions to the system. Our experiments show that the approach performs well for off-line processing and produces maps of high quality.
