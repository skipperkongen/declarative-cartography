Partition by, merge partitions, force level and all-or-nothing. Clean-up and set-up for create constraints

For practical purposes the syntax is extended with optional \emph{setup} and \emph{cleanup} sub-clauses. These are evaluated before and after the constraint SELECT statement is evaluated, and may consist of arbitrary SQL statements. The full syntax for the \emph{create-constraint} statement becomes:

\begin{lstlisting}
CREATE CONSTRAINT C1 
AS NOT EXISTS
  (SELECT cid, rid, minhits
   FROM {more SQL})
WITH SETUP
  {user-defined SQL}
WITH CLEANUP
  {user-defined SQL}
\end{lstlisting}
