\marcos{One should make sure to include the items below.}

Basic reference set:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fusion Tables~\cite{sarma2012fusiontables}. 
% zoom consistency, adjacency, visibility; not general constraints. // different types of objectives, but no declarative interface and integration with standard database technology.

\item Summary and most important references from cartographic generalization survey.

\item Reverse data management vision~\cite{meliou2011reverse}

\end{itemize}

Additional references:

\begin{itemize}

\item In-database processing: briefly repeat argument with Pathfinder and Ferry (As we mentioned earlier,...). Increasingly, relational are incorporating whole programming language interpreters and support for spatial data structures~\cite{Blakeley2008:DotNET}. Then also cite MADLib work~\cite{hellerstein12madlib} as well as Ordonez~\cite{ordonez10udf}. But: direct SQL and not higher-level DSL leveraging SQL + analytics / statistics and not spatial.  

\item Say something about how you actually serve the map after it is built with our framework (e.g., the usual references in linearization)~\cite{hilbert1891ueber}.

\item ...

\marcos{Still performing scan of recent literature, just in case.}

\item if it fits, reverse / symbolic query processing.

\end{itemize}

\martin{We should mention that the dynamic greedy algorithm would have improved the running time compared to the LP-based greedy algorithm, while achieving good quality~\cite{rajagopalan1998primal}.}
