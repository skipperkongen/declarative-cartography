# About the SQL wiki

The SQL wiki is a repository of SQL queries I've developed for CVL.

SQL includes:

* [Stored procedures](stored_procedures) for repeated tasks in CVL
* [Algorithms for general problems](algorithms) and specification of input/output
* [SQL statements for evaluating cartographic constraints](constraint_evaluation). Output is an instance of [hitting set](algorithms/hitting_set.md).
