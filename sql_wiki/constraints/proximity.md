# Evaluating proximity constraint

Problem: Make sure no two records are too close to each other (in pixels).

As for all constraints, the aim is to populate the temporary *_conflicts* table.

## SQL

Continuing with the [cph_highway](../README.md) example.

With input parameter CURRENT_Z, update temporary table *_conflicts*:

```sql
INSERT INTO _conflicts
-- TODO
```
